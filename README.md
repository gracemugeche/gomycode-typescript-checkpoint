# ðŸš— TypeScript Vehicle Interface Checkpoint

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project was created as part of the **GOMYCODE TypeScript Fundamentals Checkpoint**. It demonstrates a foundational understanding of TypeScript by using interfaces and classes to model a basic vehicle system.

The core objective was to:
- Define an interface named `Vehicle` with specific properties and a method.
- Implement a class named `Car` that follows the structure of the interface.
- Use the class to create an instance and call its method, confirming the behavior.

This demonstrates TypeScriptâ€™s strong typing, object-oriented capabilities, and how TypeScript code can be compiled and executed using Node.js.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- **TypeScript Interface**: Defines the structure of a vehicle with `make`, `model`, `year`, and a `start()` method.
- **Class Implementation**: Implements the interface using a `Car` class with a constructor.
- **Instance Creation**: Demonstrates usage by creating a `Car` object and calling its methods.
- **Project Organization**: Clean structure with `src` for source code and `dist` for compiled files.

## âœ… Conclusion

This project highlights the fundamentals of working with TypeScript's core features â€” interfaces, classes, and type safety. It is a clean, well-structured implementation that reflects both technical correctness and coding best practices. The project is a great stepping stone into more advanced TypeScript or full-stack development work.
